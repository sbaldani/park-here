# How to contribute

We are really glad if you're reading this, any kind of help in this project is appreciated.

## Bugs

If you want to report a bug, use the relevant bug report templates to create the issue.

## Submitting changes

Please send a [Pull Request to park-here](https://github.com/SantiDepetris/park-here/pull/new/develop) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). When you send a pull request, we will love you forever if you include RSpec examples. We can always use more test coverage. Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

## Testing

We have a handful of Cucumber features, but most of our testbed consists of RSpec examples. Please write RSpec examples for new code you create.

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Coding conventions

Make sure that rubocop and rails best practices analyze your code properly.

Thanks :kissing:
